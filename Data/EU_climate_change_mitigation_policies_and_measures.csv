In 2012, Slovenia has adopted Action plan to enhance the competitiveness of the Slovenian forest-wood chain by 2020, where an impact on the amount of harvested wood products use is expected as well.",,2040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/Converters/run_conversion?file=/ec/mmr/art04-13-14_lcds_pams_projections/colvzkuna/envv_5mka/SI_MMR_PAM_20160601_updated_ETC.xml&conv=524&source=remote#pam34,Implemented,1971,Not included in a projection scenario,Yes,LULUCF Decision No 529/2013/EU,,

_x000D_Principle of a system of green certificates : 1. A green certificate is allocated to a producer of green electricity every time its production avoids the emission of a fixed amount of CO2, if it had to be produced in a reference fossil fuel plant (natural gas CCGT). 2. Each year, a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of  failure, a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers. In Flanders, a similar process is established for CHP, while CHP is integrated in the green certificates system in Brussels and Wallonia. Green certificates and CHP certificates : share of electricity sales to be covered by RES and/or high efficiency CHP. Guaranteed minimum income for suppliers of green energy. Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities.
_x000D_Federal authority : (offshore windfarms; see also EP-A05)
_x000D_1. A green certificate is an immaterial good certifying that a producer produced a given amount of green electricity (ie. produced from renewable energy sources) during a given period of time
_x000D_2. There is a legal obligation for the transmission network operator (TSO) to buy all green certificates granted to the holders of a domain concession and originating from offshore wind energy production. The obligation to purchase green electricity certificates produced from offshore wind energy is the subject, on the proposal of the network operator, of a contract between the holder of the domain concession and the network manager.
_x000D_3. The final cost of this system is borne by the final consumer through a tariff overload.

_x000D_The facility of mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) servicing the Regional Waste Management System (RWMS) in Varna is built under a public-private partnership contract and has been operating since 2012. The design capacity of a 12-hour reception of household waste is 390 tonnes a day or 140,000 tonnes a year. The facility performs pre-treatment of waste by way of separation. In separation, first eligible composting waste is removed from the rest. Then the process of separation continues to achieve separation of other waste types, namely ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics, wood waste, glass, paper and cardboard. The separation is done by weighting principle, by size and by composition of waste. Separated fractions for composting are treated in a controlled environment, while aerobic treatment is carried out in closed tunnels.
_x000D_Another big facility for MBT treatment of household waste runs in the village of Shishmantsi, in the region of Plovdiv, which is in operation since 2009. This MBT plant has an annual capacity of 125,000 tonnes per year and serves the municipalities of the Regional Waste Management System (RWMS) Plovdiv. The technological process is identical to the facility in Varna.
_x000D_In early 2014, a bio-waste facility was commissioned on the territory of Sofia Municipality for food and green waste to produce electricity. Its capacity is 44,000 tonnes a year. In the process of finalizing the preparation or construction, with funding provided by the OPE 2007-2023, there are facilities for biodegradable waste recovery in another 16 Regional Waste Management Systems (RWMS), one of which is in Metropolitan (Sofia) Municipality, which contracted the construction of a large MBT facility.

Creating a competitive environment for the used energy resources. Introduction and promotion of flexible financial schemes - contracts for sale of energy. Incentives in case of combined and integrated solutions to reduce energy consumption. The Energy Strategy of Bulgaria envisages creation of conditions for access to the gas distribution system to 30% of households in 2020 and substitution of electricity used for heating purposes which would save households more than 1 bln. BGN of energy costs. The use of natural gas instead of electricity for heating and domestic purposes can save about 100 kWh/year at least, and up to 1800 kWh/year per household. 

_x000D_The evaluation of the potential decrease of emissions was made with the following assumptions: a household with 3 members, an apartment with 70 m2 of heated area, without energy saving measures, using electricity for heating and household needs. The average annual consumption of energy for heating is about 11 188 kWh. In view of the delayed implementation of policies in this area a conservative scenario with 15% gasified domestic needs was considered when assessing this measure. An emission factor was adopted with regard to electric energy as in the National Programme for Renovation of Residential Buildings in the Republic of Bulgaria. In the absence of reliable data and projections a scenario of even development was used for a period of 7 years until the total percentage rate of gasified households is reached in 2020. The analysis assumes that 430 050 households will be gasified by 2020. The effect of fuel substitution and the use of natural gas can be divided into direct effect – related to the efficiency of transformation, and additional effect – related to an environmentally cleaner fuel. The direct impact is related to immediate reduction of fuel and energy consumption, with the assumption that the energy consumption is reduced by 15% (pessimistic scenario) over the entire assessed period. It is assumed in this case that the old inefficient equipment (with higher coefficient of energy transformation) will be replaced by new one, while the different calorific value of fuels is not taken into account. In this case the substitution of the fuel base will lead to direct fuel and energy savings of 721.7GWh or 492.9ktCO2.

_x000D_The indirect effect is estimated at about 1983.4ktCO2. 65 The total amount of reduced emissions will be 2476.4 ktCO2.
_x000D_With the achievement of the 30% target set in the Strategy, the minimum savings of households will be 1443.5 GWh – direct savings resulting from the improvement of transformation efficiency, or 985.9ktCO2. In addition, the effect on the reduction of GHG emission will be a result of the use of an environmentally cleaner fuel and the total cumulative effect will be 4952.8 ktCO2. Main instrument for implementation of the measure is the introduction of institutional and fiscal incentives aimed at increasing the share of households using natural gas: creation of a competitive environment with respect to the used energy resources; introduction and promotion of flexible financial plans – contracts for sale of energy; incentives for combined and integrated solutions to reduce the energy consumption. In case of 30% gasification in 2020 , the investments of households for switching to natural gas are estimated at approximately 5000 BGN (between 1800 and 7000 BGN depending on the technological solutions) - according to a study carried out by the Strategic Consultant of the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism, selected at the end of 2011 under International Fund Kozloduy. The analysis is based on information provided by gas distribution companies and covers the households on the territory of Bulgaria that use natural gas for heating purposes. The required investments are estimated at 774 mln. BGN as a minimum, depending on the technological solutions.

The new system was drawn according to Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The relevant national law (Access to the Occupation of Road Transport Operator Law of 2001) was harmonised with the aforementioned European Union Regulation.  Two public consultations and a large number of meetings were held in order to inform the existing Public Road transport operators (holders of public passenger transport licenses) and all the stakeholders of the changes the amendment of the national law would bring to the existing state of affairs.
_x000D_From 2008 the road transport department began holding meetings with all the stakeholders in order to present the newly planned public road passenger transportation system. The new system was drawn according to the Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007.
_x000D_ The procedures that were followed up to the application of the new legislation were completely transparent. Specifically, on 24.7.2009, the amended Law ‘Access to the Occupation of Road Transport Operator’ (Amendment) (No.2) Law of 2009 (Law 101 (I) / 2009) was published. This Law came into force on 11.9.2009.  
_x000D_As noted above the national law was harmonised with Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007. However the 6 contracts were directly awarded after negotiating with the 6 newly formed companies that were formed by the existing Public Road transport operators (holders of public passenger transport licenses). According to paragraph 3(d) of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 
_x000D_On 2/12/2009 six contracts were concluded for a period of ten years (the government has the right to extend the contracts for another five years) between the Director of the Road Transport Department and the new operating companies that were formed by various existing operators, in accordance with the relevant national legislation. 
_x000D_In 2014 the current public transportation system was evaluated by the government, and was found to be unsatisfactory and unable to meet the initial targets set by the Ministry of Transport, Communication and Works. Firstly, there was no comprehensive approach to form a sound and complete public transportation system (lack of legal and organizational framework, lack of procedures and infrastructure). The competent authority was essentially responsible only for managing the contracts and overseeing compliance to them. Secondly, it was evident that contractors did not have the necessary experience in the provision of public passenger transportation services based on citizen – customer service. Thirdly, the current system did not provide any incentives to the contractors to improve the services provided to the citizen and/ or to reduce the cost of service.

_x000D_The Ministry of Transport, Communication and Works, in an effort to upgrade public passenger transportation, has set short-term goals such as to optimize routes, by reducing   unprofitable lines and increasing the frequency of those lines that have denser ridership, to estimate the actual cost per kilometer for the years that the operators have audited accounts and to set a number of incentives for the contractors to reflect their effectiveness.  The medium-term targets that have been set relate to fleet renewal, to improve infrastructure (bus stops, stations, use of telematic technology), to improve the image of the service to the general public, to increase passenger ridership and to reduce subsidies. Finally, the long-term target of the Ministry of Transport, Communication and Works is the complete restructuring of the passenger transportation system and the establishment of a well performing system responsive to the needs of society.

_x000D_The implementation of Greek RES Roadmap is based on a sound legislative framework, the core of which is the law 3851/2010 (OG A/85/4th June 2010) on “Accelerating the development of Renewable Energy Sources to deal with climate change and other regulations in topics under the authority of the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change”, along with the recent Law 4254/2014.

_x000D_The legislative framework aims to accelerate the permitting procedure of the larger projects as much as possible, simplifies considerably the licensing of smaller projects, offers new attractive feed-in-tariffs for all RES technologies,  introduces new clauses for offshore wind, deals with the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) phenomenon at several levels and establishes an Autonomous RES Office to act as a One-Stop-Shop for RES-Electricity. Law 3833/2010 specifies which renewable energy sources (wind, solar, tidal power etc.) are exempted from excise duties, when they are used for the generation of electricity for private purposes only.

The large companies are covered by the mandatory energy audit. 
_x000D_Various programmes promoting energy-efficiency measures for businesses have been completed over the last 30 years. The present energy-saving programme on development and implementation of campaigns, market impact activities, etc., focussed on private enterprises, and since 2012 this has been run by the Danish Energy Agency.
_x000D_Energy savings in businesses have been intensified since 2006, due to the energy-saving efforts by energy companies. Around 40% of the energy savings under the initiative were realised by businesses in the period 2006-2009. This share has increased to almost 50% in 2013. 
_x000D_Finally, the programme aims to consolidate and strengthen the Minister’s and the Danish Energy Agency’s regulatory assignments concerning energy savings.
_x000D_As an element in the implementation of the 2012 energy policy agreement, a DKK 3.75 billion (€500m) fund has been established to subsidise industries to convert to renewable energy. As of August 2013, businesses will be able to get support from this fund to convert to renewable energy sources or district heating in accordance with the following objectives:
_x000D_•	Support businesses to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy – such as wind, solar, biogas or biomass – to power manufacturing

_x000D_•	Support businesses to replace fossil fuels by district heating. E.g. horticulture will be able to change from coal-fired boilers to district heating

_x000D_•	Support businesses to invest in energy-efficiency measures.

_x000D_The estimated effect of this “Renewables for industry” initiative is a reduction of 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year from 2020 and onwards.

_x000D_Targeted work to improve energy efficiency specifically in the public sector has been going on for many years, and considerable savings have been achieved. However, there are still economically viable possibilities for savings. This is illustrated by the fact that there is a very big difference in consumption (per m2) between comparable institutions.
_x000D_Data on energy consumption in the public sector have been collected for some years as a means of rendering the sector's energy consumption visible. There are complete inventories of energy consumption in municipalities and state institutions.
_x000D_The action plan for a renewed energy saving effort from 2005 also contains a number of initiatives to save energy in the public sector. The main initiatives in this respect are:
_x000D_•	A circular on energy efficiency in state institutions (including implementation of profitable energy savings, energy-efficient behaviour and operation and energy-efficient procurement).
_x000D_•	Guidelines for procurement in the public sector, e.g. through preparation of environmental guidelines for large buyers in the public sector.
_x000D_•	Energy labelling and energy-checking of large properties.
_x000D_•	Information activities and tools in relation to energy-efficient lighting, ventilation and office equipment, etc. 
_x000D_•	Consultancy by supply companies for institutions.
_x000D_As mentioned above, the action plan was evaluated in December 2008. New political measures were adopted in 2009 and in 2014 the circular on energy efficiency in state institutions was reviewed in line with the requirements in the EU Energy Efficiency Directive",,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/Converters/run_conversion?file=/dk/eu/mmr/art04-13-14_lcds_pams_projections/pams/envvyjguq/DK_MMR_PAM_20150622.xml&conv=524&source=remote#pam23,Implemented,2014,With existing measures,Yes,Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC; Directive 2006/32/EC on end-use energy efficiency and energy services; Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU,,

_x000D_1 In January 2013, the rate was 2.458, and from February to December the rate was 2.869.

_x000D_From 1 June 1999 a tax differentiation between light diesel and diesel low in sulphur was introduced, to encourage the use of diesel low in sulphur, which is less polluting than light diesel. This was accomplished and a change took place soon after to the effect that almost all diesel sold was low in sulphur. The purpose of further differentiation from 1 January 2005 favouring sulphur-free diesel was likewise to encourage the use of this type of diesel in favour of diesel low in sulphur, and this has been successful. 
_x000D_In addition, tax differentiation has been introduced in order to achieve environmental goals other than direct reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Thus tax differentiation has been introduced with a view to phasing out lead in petrol. The rate of tax to achieve this environmental goal is shown in Table 4.7.

_x000D_The electricity tax was introduced on 1 April 1977. With effect from 1 January 2013, the tax on electricity used for heating was reduced considerably, to take into account, that an increasing amount of renewable energy was being used in electricity production. It has been estimated that this will lead to an emission reduction outside the emissions trading scheme of 0.15 million tonnes CO2 in 2015 and 0.29 million tonnes in 2018.

The EU Member States have devised this trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions in order to fulfil the international climate commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in particular with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from energy production and energy-intensive industries.
_x000D_The allowances scheme entered into force on 1 January 2005. The 2005-2007 period was used as a testing phase. The EU ETS Directive has been revised a number of times.
_x000D_The allowance allocation for 2008-2012 was determined on the basis of the national allocation plan from July 2006, submitted the European Commission. The EU ETS 2008-2012 has been an important measure in Denmark's fulfilment of its climate obligations under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The scheme aligns well with government policy for the energy area on liberalisation of the energy markets and management of environment efforts by the market.
_x000D_The installations subject to the allowance regulations account for a little less than half of Danish emissions of greenhouse gases. Almost all major Danish installations with considerable emissions are covered by the ETS. Most of these are generators of power and heat, the rest are industrial enterprises plus a few production units within the offshore sector.
_x000D_Both the statutory and the administrative basis for the scheme have been established. The necessary legal basis was adopted by the Danish Folketing in June 2004 and the 2008-2012 national allocation plan was approved by the European Commission on 31 August 2007.
_x000D_According to the national allocation plan for the period 2008-2012 an average annual allowance of 24.5 million tonnes CO2 has been allocated. According to the allocation plan this should correspond to a drop in annual emissions of about 5 million tonnes per year in 2008-2012, or a reduction of about 17% compared with emissions expected in the national allocation plan for the period. This level was set by balancing environmental considerations against competitiveness and jobs:

_x000D_•	Electricity and heat producers were allocated about 15.8 million EAUs. The allowance for electricity generation is allocated as ”per kWh”, while for heat production allowances are allocated according to emissions in the base years 1998-2004. 

_x000D_•	The other 133 installations (industry and offshore) have been allocated allowances corresponding to emissions in the base years 1998-2004. A total of 8.2 million tonnes CO2 per year have been allocated to industry and offshore. 

_x000D_•	A special reserve of 0.5 million tonnes CO2 per year has been allocated with free allowances for new installations and significant extensions to existing units.

_x000D_Allowances not allocated by the end of the commitment period or returned due to closures have been auctioned. The period 2008 – 2012 was finalized in 2013 with the final surrendering of allowances and credits by companies participating in the EU ETS as shown in section 4.3.1.
_x000D_The new EU Climate and Energy Agreement from December 2008 extended the ETS system to 2013-2020 in order for the EU to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% in 2020. At the same time allocation was centralised and auctioning is to be used more extensively from 2013. The allowances have been calculated for this period in accordance with the EU benchmarking decision 2011/278/EU. Annex 1f contains an overview of the installations and aviation operators covered and their allowance allocation for 2013-2020.
_x000D_However, the current low allowances price has made it more difficult to initiate the necessary transition and green investments after 2012.
_x000D_Developments in allowances prices have particular significance for Danish emissions and they affect the need to initiate other, new mitigation initiatives.

_x000D_“Better Home” is a new scheme from the Danish Energy Agency focusing on energy renovation of private homes. The aim is to make it easier for homeowners to energy renovate their homes by creating a “one stop shop” for energy renovation for private home owners, where the owner only has to contact one certified building contractor and to get an overall counselling on energy renovation of the entire building.

_x000D_The Government adopted in May 2014 a strategy for energy renovation of buildings. The strategy contains 21 initiatives which will promote the renovation of the Danish building stocks and insures that energy efficiency measures are implemented on the buildings. It is expected, that the effect of the strategy on energy consumption will be a reduction of net energy consumption for heating and hot water with 35 pct. in 2050 compared with today. The strategy includes following initiatives:
_x000D_•	Revision and upgrade of building regulations and energy requirements that applies to renovation and retrofitting of existing buildings
_x000D_•	New requirements to the energy efficiency of windows. These requirements will be tightened in 2015 and 2020. Furthermore new requirements will be defined for windows, which are installed in buildings after 2020.
_x000D_•	Information to building owners, construction companies, financial institutions etc.  on energy how to improve energy efficiency
_x000D_•	Revision of the energy certificates scheme to improve the efficiency of the scheme
_x000D_•	Promotion of the ESCO-concept
_x000D_•	Promotion of energy efficiency in public buildings

_x000D_Denmark has long experience with energy efficiency and energy savings in buildings. Since 1980 energy consumption for heating has been reduced by 27% per m2. The goal is to reduce energy consumption in new buildings by 75% by 2020 relative to 2006. The benefits of reducing energy consumption are tangible: less fossil fuel is consumed and the environment has improved substantially. Strict and progressively tightened building regulations since 1977 have ensured a stable demand for energy-efficient building technologies.

_x000D_Energy labelling of buildings when built, sold or rented
_x000D_Energy labelling of buildings must be implemented after finishing the construction of a building and on the sale or rental of the building - primarily heating consumption. This applies in principle for all buildings, irrespective of size, apart from production facilities, factories etc.

The subsidies were to be used to reduce the environmental impact of waste.  Two projects with reduction of methane emissions were supported:
_x000D_a. To address the obstacles and to improve the method, another biocover-project was initiated in 2007 as part of the Enterprise Scheme. The project was performed on another landfill (i.e. not the landfill in the biocover-pilotproject 2005-2006 carried out with support from Danish EPA and the EU LIFE programme), and was taking the identified difficulties into account. A reduction of the methane emission of 79-93 % was reported in the project.
_x000D_b. In 2007 subsidies from the enterprise scheme were also given for establishing methane recovery and test pumping at 11 landfill sites. The results were reported in 2011 and showed a reduction of the emission of methane over a five year period equalling 84,435 tonnes of CO2 equivalents.

_x000D_(Α) Interventions in the transport system
_x000D_Public works to enhance the existing infrastructure described in the previous National Communications (road-grid improvements in the large urban centres, reconstruction of major highways, improvements in the traffic-light system) are in progress.
_x000D_Programmes for the upgrading of the traffic lights system (road signaling), as well as the overall traffic management and control have been developed since 2002 in Athens. Therefore, half of the traffic lights in the region of Athens (roughly 1500) are in cooperation, while the Center of Traffic Management, which belongs to the Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks collects traffic information from 842 traffic nodes in a daily base. According to collected information, processes for the improvement of the road signaling have been established. 

_x000D_(Β) Interventions in public transport
_x000D_Important interventions have already been implemented or are under development aiming at the enforcement of public transport. In Athens, the two new metro lines, which were completed and started operation in 2000, are being expanded, while new metro lines are in the implementation phase. In Thessaloniki a new metro line is under construction. The operation of suburban railway in the wider area of Athens has already started, the connection to Corinthos was completed, while the connections with Livadia and Chalcida are expected to operate in the near future. Also in 2004, a new tram started operating in Athens with 2 lines reaching from the center of the city to the southern waterfront suburbs.
_x000D_Concerning rail transport, since 2000, more than 250 km of new rail lines have been constructed (including replacement of old single lines), while more than 220 km rail lines have been converted to electrical driven. Besides, more than 300 km of new rail lines are under construction phase.     
_x000D_An extended network of bus lanes of approximately 50 km length has already been created, resulting in the increase of the average speed of buses in Athens from 16 km/h to 23 km/h. The fleet of buses has been renewed to a large extent, while approximately 600 buses approximately use natural gas as fuel and 100 buses operate with engines of Euro V technology. Moreover the renewal of the fleet of electrically driven buses (trolleys) began in 1998 with the supply of 224 vehicles and was extended with the supply of additional 142 vehicles by the end of 2004. 
_x000D_In addition, by Law 2963/2001 (A 268), an age limit of 23 years has been instituted for all urban, semi-urban and long distance buses. Also the limit of 11 years was set as the higher permissible age for buses in public transport. Under the provisions of the same law, economic incentives were given in the owners for the replacement of vehicles with new or used vehicles of small age. Of the 5000 semi-urban and long distance buses licensed in Greece, 1846 buses have been replaced since 2004, of which 1746 with  new and 100 with used  of age lower than 5 years. Moreover, the replacement of tourist coaches was encouraged by subsidies provided for in Article 31 of Law 3229/2004. By Article 7 of Law 2446/96, an age limit of 23 years has been also instituted for them. The replacement program was supervised by the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism. 
_x000D_Finally, the public transport system in Athens is being reorganized on the basis of the new metro and tram lines, with buses and trolleys also playing a complementary role of connecting the metro and tram stations with other areas of the city.

The sustainable management of the forest land was early legislated (Presidential Decree 19-11-1928) while the sustainability of the significant multi-functioning role of forests (e.g. erosion protection, regulation of the water budget, conservation of biodiversity) has been ensured through the directive 958/1953.

_x000D_The measures for the LULUCF sector are arisen from rural development actions and other financial mechanisms. In the overall Greek fiscal deficiency the policies already implemented and measures taken, and those that are expected to be adopted according to the Rural Development Program “Alexandros Mpaltatzis” (concerning the forth programming period 2007-2013) aim for the above mentioned targets achievement, contribute to the mitigation of the climate change, and could be divided into the following broad categories:

_x000D_1.	Forest protection
_x000D_        	A large number of activities take place every year in the context of the forest fires prevention policy. The fuel management and the vegetation treatment at the most vulnerable forest areas, the conservation of the existing mountainous road network and the development of new roads where necessary, the regular patrolling during the fire season, and the public awareness campaigns are the main preventative measures against forest fires.
_x000D_        	Furthermore, the Greek Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEEN) elaborates policy measures in the context of the acceleration and simplification of the national Forest Map project under the national Cadastre Survey. The development of Forest Maps involves the delineation and recording of forest lands that fall under the protective provisions of Greek forest legislation in an accurate, transparent and definitive way. With the completion of the current Forest Map project the 62.5% of the total estimated forest area is expected to be recorded, while the procurement for the rest area is due in 2013. 
_x000D_2.	Forest management
_x000D_       	One of the main responsibilities of the Greek Forest Services is the forest management through the development and implementation of the Forest Management Plans. For that purposes, financial and human resources are allocated in order either to update the Forest Management Plans that have been expired or to develop new ones. The public forest wood production (timber, industrial and fuelwood) in 2010  was approximately 738,806.00 m3, while the wood production from private forests (approximately 36% of the total forest land) was approximately 309,156.00 m3. 
_x000D_       	Additionally, in some regions the treatment of the forests for resin production purposes is being implemented with a significant economic, social and ecological (preventative) value.
_x000D_3.	Restoration – increase of forest lands
_x000D_       	The rehabilitation of burnt and degraded (flood and erosion protection) forest lands has always been a main part in the Forest Service’s agenda. During 2010 the public nurseries in operation numbered 33 in which 4,928,686.00 of plants of different forest species (evergreen, deciduous) were produced. The area reforested in 2008, 2009, and 2010, as well as the amount of money spent on those projects were 1,118.00 ha, 1,124.00 ha, 0.531 ha, and 2,195,000.00€, 1,879,200.00€, and 808,500.00€, respectively.
_x000D_4.	Adaptation of forest management to climate change
_x000D_      	In January 2010, the Life+ project entitled AdaptFor “Adaptation of Forest Management to climate change in Greece” was launched, which is implemented by the Goulandris Natural History Museum / Greek Biotope - Wetland Centre in cooperation with the General Directorate for the Development and Protection of Forests and Natural Environment (MEEN), and is expected to be completed in June 2013.

Types of supports range from visits to individual sites to advanced supports for whole organisations who commit to a 3% annual energy saving. Advanced supports include: Dedicated energy advisor; Strategic energy planning; Prioritisation of energy efficiency opportunities; Coordination of energy efficiency activities; Detailed & in-depth assessments; Advanced & targeted training; Working group facilitation; Energy Efficient Design; Monitoring of progress and savings.
_x000D_Energy Supplier Obligation: In accordance with Article 7, Ireland will implement an Energy Supplier Obligation with an annual target currently set at 550GWh per annum. A portion of these savings will be achieved in the public sector.
_x000D_Energy Efficiency Fund: The Irish Government has committed €35 million as seed capital for investment in an Energy Efficiency Fund. This has been matched with investment from the private sector and a fund of €70 million has been established. The fund will enhance the level of finance available in the market to support the clear opportunity that exists in the public and commercial sectors.
_x000D_National Energy Services Framework (NESF): SEAI will provide supports to develop the contractual arrangements and mechanisms to promote the use of the fund via innovative finance arrangements including energy performance contracts (via ESCOs) and via direct lending to client companies.

_x000D_This policy leads to an increase in ESD emissions. This is because many household appliances emit heat as well as providing their main function.  For example, a light bulb emits heat as well as providing light.  Some of this heat is useful, as it provides heat for houses during cold winter months.  Products policy measures improve the energy efficiency of appliances.  While this leads to a reduction in electricity consumption it also reduces the amount of heat that is emitted by appliances.

The plan was drafted and submitted to the EC on January 9th 2015, and will form an integral part of the national strategy for low carbon development.
_x000D_As part of the action plan defined are measures for maintaining/reducing emissions and maintaining/increasing sinks of greenhouse gases that occur as a result of implementation of activities of forest management, cropsland management, grazing land management, and implementation of afforestation and deforestation. The basis for the preparation of the aforementioned document was the draft of Rural Development Programme of the Republic of Croatia for the period 2014-2020 (the document is in the process of harmonization with the European Commission) to define the measures in the forestry sector as well as to define the measures associated with agricultural land use categories. During the document preparation, used were data and information available in the National Inventory Report on Greenhouse Gas Emissions for the Republic of Croatia (NIR 2014), as well as the data and information available in a number of different strategic documents, national regulations (e.g. Ordinance on cross-compliance OG 27/14) and the European Commission Guidance , which was created in order to assist Member States in fulfilling the obligations defined under Article 10 of the Decision 529/2013/EU. In order to address future activities within the low-carbon development strategy it should be noted that the Air Protection Act (OG 130/11, 47/14) stipulates the obligation of adopting the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia, which ensures a long-term economic and social development towards a low-GHG emission society. Low-Carbon Development Strategy defines the guidelines for long term actions by defining objectives in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1 of the Regulation (EU) No. 525/2013 and determining measures for their realization, taking into account the current situation and international obligations. Given that some of the strategic plans were adopted prior to or at the beginning of the process of Croatian accession to the European Union, and that they e.g. National Environmental Strategy (OG 46/02) do not contain provisions relating to maintaining/increasing carbon pools in forest ecosystems and wood products, it will be necessary to revise them in the coming period and to align them with provisions of the legislative acts which were adopted after the Croatian accession to the European Union. Additionally, upon the adoption of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy, certain modifications of some strategic documents that are of particular importance to the horizontal level will be required, e.g. Sustainable Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia (OG 30/09).

The Rural Development Programme for Mainland Finland 2014-2020 is an essential tool for promoting sustainable development in agriculture. Agri-environmental payment is a part of the programme. Approximately 90 per cent of Finnish farmers have participated in the support scheme. 

_x000D_As from 2015 new environmental requirements will be incorporated into the single payments under the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU.  30 per cent of the direct payments are tied to the so-called greening. There are three greening measures that the farmers must implement in their eligible area. 

_x000D_1) Crop diversification: at least two cultivated crops on farms with an area of 10-30 hectares of arable land and three crops on farms with over 30 hectares of arable land. By derogation, only two crops are required on farms with over 10 ha on farms located in support area C. The rule does not concern farms with over 75 per cent of grass and/or fallow if the arable are in use is not more than 30 hectares.

_x000D_2) Preserving permanent grassland; in the whole country the area of permanent grassland may not decrease by more than 5%; also preservation requirement for grasslands in the Natura areas. 

_x000D_3) Requirement concerning ecological focus area: the minimum of 5% of the area of the farm must be so-called ecological focus area (e.g. fallow, nitrogen-fixing plants and short-rotation energy wood). The required share may increase to 7% in 2018. Possible derogations for areas and farms that meet certain requirements (e.g. areas dominated by forest and farms with mostly grassland and/or fallow).",,,,"More information available at

The objective of this policy is to boost energy savings by putting an incentive on reducing the consumption of gas and electricity, which should direct consumers toward more energy efficient behaviour. The Regulatory Energy Tax (REB) was introduced in 1996, changing its name to Energy Tax in 2004. Taxing energy use makes energy saving (by changing behaviour or investing in energy-saving measures) more attractive. The energy tax is levied on electricity and natural gas, and the level of the Energy Tax depends on 1) the energy consumption of a customer – the higher the consumption, the lower the energy tax levied (degressive tariff structure) –, and 2) specific agreements between different sectors and the government.
_x000D_For small (residential) consumers the Energy Tax accounted for approximately ~40% of the natural gas and ~30% of electricity price in 2012. Industrial consumers pay a much lower tariff because of their larger consumption. In addition, there is a specific clause in the Environmental Taxes Act (Article 36q), which exempts companies that enter into a Long Term Agreement with the government from paying energy taxes on electricity consumption that goes over 10 million kWh per year and from taxes on fuel for non-energy use (feedstocks). The Energy Tax also has a separate lower gas tariff for the horticulture sector (fixed up to 2013). This means that these companies are taxed in the same way as the energy-intensive large-scale consumers. In return, the sector has entered into voluntary agreements on energy efficiency with the government.",No quantitative ex-ante objectoves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/Converters/run_conversion?file=/ec/mmr/art04-13-14_lcds_pams_projections/colvzkuna/envvzkvxq/NL_MMR_PAM_20150622.xml&conv=524&source=remote#pam8,Implemented,1996,With existing measures,No,No information,,

The main aims of this Covenant are:
_x000D_• CO2 emissions: a reduction of 3.5 to 4.5 Mt in 2020 compared to 1990.
_x000D_• Other greenhouse gases: reduction of 4.0 to 6.0 Mt CO2 equivalents in 2020 compared to 1990.
_x000D_• Energy saving: an average annual energy efficiency improvement of 2% over the period 2011-2020.
_x000D_• Approximately 150 PJ of sustainable energy in 2020, including approximately 12 PJ of wind energy.

_x000D_Under the convenant also continuation of some previously implemented measures is included. The convenant therefore is a package of continued (sometime slightly modified) measures and new additional measures.
_x000D_The sector is expected to take cost-effective measures that contribute to emission reductions of greenhouse gases. There are three categories of measures that can contribute to reducing emissions:
_x000D_• Developing Best Management Practices for reducing N2O emissions. The emissions are reduced by reducing nitrogen flows on farms.
_x000D_• Taking measures related to cattle feed to reduce CH4 emissions. The composition of feed can affect the production of methane via the cattle’s digestive systems. In general: the better the digestibility, the lower the methane emissions.
_x000D_• Taking measures concerning manure storage to reduce emissions of CH4. Manure fermentation is the main option for reducing methane emissions from manure.
_x000D_An important legislation for restricting the amount of CH4 emissions is found in the (EU) milk quota, which limits the number of dairy herds held in the NL. The number of dairy herds in NL is still uncertain after 2015 when the milk quota system will have ended.
_x000D_From 2013 onwards, new environmental policies on manure use will apply. They will have a significant (positive) effect on the climate, as they promise to increase CH4 production for renewable energy.",,,,,,http://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/duurzaam-ondernemen/groene-economie/agrosectoren,0,200,,,,,,,,,,http://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/duurzaam-ondernemen/groene-economie/agrosectoren,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/Converters/run_conversion?file=/ec/mmr/art04-13-14_lcds_pams_projections/colvzkuna/envvzkvxq/NL_MMR_PAM_20150622.xml&conv=524&source=remote#pam22,Implemented,2008,With existing measures,No,No information,,

Dans le cadre des PDU, le soutien de l’Etat aux plans de déplacement d’entreprises, d’administrations, d’écoles ou de zones d’activité a été réaffirmé dans le cadre de l’article 13 de la loi n° 2009-967 du 3 août 2009. La loi n° 2010-788 du 12 juillet 2010 portant engagement national pour l'environnement (article 63) prévoit par ailleurs que les PDU, lors de leur élaboration ou de leur révision, devront désormais comporter une évaluation des émissions évitées de CO2 attendues par la mise en oeuvre du plan. L’obligation est étendue à tous les gaz à effet de serre à compter de 2015. (il s’agit de l’article L.1214-8-1 du code des transports). Le décret n° 2012-616 du 2 mai 2012 fixe les modalités applicables aux évaluations des documents de planification, plans, schémas ou programmes ayant une incidence sur l'environnement.

L'activité d'autopartage consiste en la mise en commun, au profit d'utilisateurs abonnés, d'une flotte de véhicules. Chaque abonné peut accéder à un véhicule sans conducteur pour le trajet de son choix et pour une durée limitée. Les personnes exerçant cette activité peuvent demander l'attribution d'un label. Le décret en précise les conditions. Les véhicules doivent respecter un seuil d'émission de dioxyde de carbone, être conformes à la dernière norme Euro en vigueur, être utilisés dans le cadre d'un contrat d'abonnement et leur mise à disposition s'effectuer à partir de stations situées à proximité d'un moyen de transport collectif. Le label est délivré, pour une durée comprise entre dix-huit et quarante-huit mois, par l'autorité territorialement compétente en matière de transports urbains et, en Ile-de-France, par le Syndicat des transports d'Ile-de-France (STIF). Une vignette est apposée sur chaque véhicule labellisé.

A cet effet, elles fixent les caractéristiques techniques des véhicules au regard, notamment, des objectifs de réduction de la pollution et des gaz à effet de serre qu’elles déterminent et les conditions d’usage de ces véhicules auxquelles est subordonnée la délivrance du label.

_x000D_The measures undertaken support the dissemination of conservation methods for soil cultivation without tillage, limiting the emissions of gases originating from mineralisation of organic matter. The effectiveness of the use of mulching systems under differentiated habitat and production conditions of the field crop production continued to improve, through: (i) the limitation of the intensity of soil cultivation and, as a result, the limitation of the mineralisation of the organic matter in soil; (ii) an increase in the organic matter in soil which decays into nutrients and, as a result, a reduction in mineral fertilisation; and (iii) an increase in the organic matter in soil, improving its sorption properties and, as a result, e.g. the mineral fertiliser storage capacity.

_x000D_Apart from this, as part of the system of direct payments, support was continued for the cultivation of leguminous and small-seed papilionacoeus plants the cultivation of which makes it possible to limit the use of mineral nitrogen fertilisers. It also has a significant effect on the balance of the greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture (reducing the energy requirement of production and the use of nitrogen fertilizers) and having a favourable effect on the soil structure and carbon sequestration in soil).

_x000D_As a result of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy implemented from 2015, in Poland obligatory component of new system direct payments, i.e. greening practices, was introduced.

_x000D_Greening practices covers crop diversification, the keeping of permanent grasslands and the maintenance of ecological focus areas (EFAs).
_x000D_The crop diversification practice applies to farms with 10 ha or more of arable land and consists in the obligation to keep at least 2 or 3 different crops on arable land, depending on their surface areas in the farm. It is also covered by the RDP 2014-2020 measure, package 1, “The agri-environment-climate measure”. Moreover, the scope of the requirement related to crop diversification goes beyond the greening requirements in the system of direct payments.

Finland’s land use planning system, as defined in the law, gives municipalities a high degree of autonomy in local land use planning. Community structure development is controlled with land use planning and building permission schemes.
_x000D_A local detailed plan lays out the organization of land use and building within the municipality and directs land use and building according to the requirements set by local conditions, the townscape and the landscape, good building practices and other agreed objectives. 
_x000D_Municipal land use plans and land policy include actual land use planning processes and other land use planning, as well as industrial, social and housing policy and planning instruments, such as building ordinance. The building ordinance is municipalities' primary tool for controlling construction, laying down regulations and instructions corresponding to local conditions. By developing alternatives of urban and regional form and building in the land use planning have an impact also on greenhouse gas emissions.",,,,"The selection under ""Union policy which resulted in the implementation of the PAM"" is ""Non related"".

A long list of direct and indirect support schemes and policies have, in combination, created a domestic market which has given Danish companies a boost. This boost has enabled many companies to become international market leaders. Danish companies continue to enjoy commercial success within the energy-related marketplace.
_x000D_R&D activities include energy savings, more efficient energy conversion and renewable energy technologies.
_x000D_Research and development activities in the field of energy are not motivated solely by climate issues, but are relevant to climate issues, since they contribute to determining the overall framework for the CO2 intensity of energy production and consumption in the future.
_x000D_In 2006 the government suggested that public programmes supporting RD&D in energy technologies should be doubled from approx. DKK 500 million to DKK 1 billion per year in 2010. This goal has been reached and the government has continued the increased effort in the years after 2010. The funding is being administrated by several programmes, including the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP), three different PSO funds (Public Service Obligation) programmes and from 2014 Danmarks Innovationsfond. This innovation foundation replaces the former programme committee on energy and environment under the Strategic Research Council under the Ministry of Education and the Advanced Technology Foundation.
_x000D_The EUDP focuses on development and demonstration of new energy technologies. A board, nominated by the Minister, is responsible for the allocation of funds. The Board is served by a secretariat established in the Danish Energy Agency. The overall objective of the EUDP is to support the government’s energy policy objective of providing cost-effective, environmentally friendly and safe energy supply, and to contribute to promoting the competitiveness of Danish enterprises in the field of energy. The activities focus on new efficient energy technologies. The EUDP was established in 2008. Available funds in recent years have been approx. DKK 400 million including some minor funds targetting specific technologies, the funds being agreed when negotiating the Financial Budget. On average, 45-50% of the activities under the Programme are financed by the EUDP.
_x000D_Energy research, development and demonstration are supported by PSO funds (Public Service Obligation). One of these is administrated by the transmission system operator Energinet.dk. The programme is aiming at research and development in environmentally friendly power production technology, administering in 2013 support funds amounting to DKK 130 million. Under this scheme support is given to activities relating to fuel cells and renewable energy, for instance solar cells, biomass, hydropower and wave energy. The activities are tending to focus more on energy system questions as increased amounts of renewable energy is fed into the grid.
_x000D_Another programme administrated by Energinet.dk is a programme of yearly DKK 25 million for the deployment of new technologies. This programme started in 2008 and has been extended to include 2015.
_x000D_The third PSO programme is administrated on behalf of the power distribution companies by the Danish power association Dansk Energi. The objective is to support research and development within energy-efficient use of electricity. In 2013, DKK 25 million are available under the scheme, which aims at the development of energy-efficient products and processes in buildings, industry etc.
_x000D_Activities relating to strategic energy research and innovation are since 2014 administered by Danmarks Innovationsfond.

The agreement has been adjusted several times.

_x000D_In 2013, biomass accounted for approximately 62% of renewable-energy production (wind accounted for 29% with the remaining 6% from heat pumps, photo voltaic power, geothermal and hydro power) and 69% of renewable energy consumption, mostly in the form of straw, wood and biodegradable waste for incineration. In 2013, 32% of the biomass was imported in the form of wood pellets (32.2 PJ), biofuels (6.4 PJ), wood chips (6.0 PJ) and fire wood (3.0 PJ).

_x000D_The energy production from biomass has more than doubled since 1990 - primarily due to the policy agreement from 1993 (the Biomass Agreement: requires power plants to use 1.4 million tonnes of straw and wood, equivalent to almost 20 PJ per year) and the policy agreement from February 2008 on the increased use of straw and chips at the large co-generation plants (up to 700,000 tonnes in 2011).

_x000D_The CO2 tax on energy products was introduced on 1 March 1992 and was imposed on different types of energy products relative to their CO2 emissions. A tax reduction was given to light and heavy industrial processes. From 1 January 2010 a structural change in the CO2 tax was implemented as an adaption to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The tax rate was increased to DKK 150 /tonne of CO2 indexed by 1.8%/year, cf. table 4.11. In total, this structural change in the CO2 tax was estimated to lead to a reduction in the CO2 emissions of 0.69 million tonnes.
_x000D_Large waste incineration facilities are from 1 January 2013 included in the emissions trading scheme, which means that in order to avoid double taxation they are exempted from the CO2 tax. This will lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions outside the ETS of approximately 8.9 million tonnes.

For the industries not regulated by the emissions trading scheme, a fixed lump sum transfer based on historical emissions was given, while the base rate was considerably increased to match the expected price of CO2 quotas.
_x000D_2Before 2010, the industrial processes covered by the ETS were taxed according to the table, depending on the type of process

_x000D_In addition to this, there are CO2 taxes on heating tar, crude oil, coke, crude oil coke, lignite briquettes and lignite, LPG, and other gases. As evident from Table 4.12, the CO2 taxes were reduced from 1 July 2004. This reduction, however, does not mean a reduction in the tax burden and resulting increased CO2 emissions. The tax reductions were part of a reorganisation of the energy taxes to make them more transparent, and the energy taxes on the different energy products have been raised correspondingly, so that the overall tax on the individual product is the same. As part of the reorganisation of the taxes, from 1 January 2005 a tax was placed on petrol and the energy tax on petrol was reduced correspondingly, so that the total tax burden on petrol remains unchanged. This reorganisation was introduced in order to make it possible to exempt biofuels from CO2 tax. 
_x000D_As of 1 January 2008 the CO2 taxes follow a yearly regulation of 1.8% in the period 2008-2015, similar to the energy taxes.

This is expected to reduce methane emissions from gas engines through behavioural changes such as changing from motor operation to boiler operation and establishing mitigation measures. Consumption is also expected to fall as the price of heat will increase. These behavioural changes will result in falls in the emissions of unburned methane from power stations. In addition, CO2 emissions will fall and consumption of natural gas will fall.

_x000D_This policy leads to increased ESD emissions in 2020. This is because Warm Front was targeted primarily at households at risk of fuel poverty with a broken boiler or heating system. Typically, these homes – who have severely constrained budgets – would be using portable electric plug-in heaters as a coping mechanism if Warm Front had not replaced their broken gas boiler with a new, efficient one. This results in Warm Front saving primarily electricity (in the traded sector) and increasing primarily gas use (in the non-traded sector) compared to the counterfactual where the household would have continued to use the coping mechanism. These boilers have a fixed lifetime and hence this effect is reduced beyond 2020.

_x000D_With the framework of the Operational Program Enterprise and Innovation for the period 2007–2013, the Ministry of Industry and Trade is introducing a total of 15 aid programs, one of them is oriented on Eco-energy. Eco-energy is oriented on energy savings by means of replacing old technologies and on generation of electricity or heat from renewable resources. Funding derives in part from EU structural funds (85%) and in part from the state budget (15%). Funding is paid out in the form of non-returnable subsidies, preferential loans and guarantees.

_x000D_The program covers the following measures:
_x000D_• the modernisation or replacement of existing energy production facilities for internal purposes, which will increase their efficiency;
_x000D_• the introduction and upgrading of measurement and control systems;
_x000D_• modernisation, reconstruction and loss reduction in electricity and heat distribution systems in buildings and production plants;
_x000D_• the implementation of measures to improve the energy performance of buildings in the business sector (building envelope insulation, the replacement and renovation of windows and doors, other structural measures having a demonstrable influence on the energy performance of buildings, the installation of ventilation technology with waste heat recuperation);
_x000D_• re-use of waste energy in production processes;
_x000D_• improvements in energy performance and energy efficiency in production and technological processes;
_x000D_• the installation of renewable energy sources for an undertaking’s own consumption;
_x000D_• the installation of a cogeneration unit with maximum use of electricity and thermal energy for the undertaking’s internal consumption, the support of extra costs in achieving the standard of a nearly zero-energy building and a passive energy standard in the reconstruction or construction of new business buildings. Extra costs will be derived from model examples and, for the purposes of support, will be set as a fixed amount for a clearly measurable quantity (e.g. per square metre of energy-related area).
_x000D_The target audience includes business entities (small, medium-sized and, where appropriate, large enterprises); for intervention in the field of energy savings (the insulation of production and business structures), also agricultural holdings, food

_x000D_Denmark has had taxes on energy for many years . Since the first oil crisis in the early 1970s, the rates of the taxes have been aimed at reducing consumption and promoting the instigation of more energy-saving measures. Lower energy consumption will reduce emissions of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) associated with combustion of fossil fuels. Energy taxes from recent years are stated in Table 4.5 below.

_x000D_2From 1 January 2011 – 30 June 2011 the rate was 1955.2 DKK/toe, where toe is the energy unit “tonnes oil equivalents”.

_x000D_Danish energy taxes are laid down in the four Danish tax acts on mineral-oil, gas, coal, and electricity, respectively (Mineralolieafgiftsloven, Gasafgiftsloven, Kulafgiftsloven, and Elafgiftsloven). As from 1 January 2016 the tax rates set in these four tax acts follow a yearly regulation based on the consumer price index of two years prior. It has been estimated that the indexation will lead to a reduction in emissions of 1 million tonnes CO2 in 2025.
_x000D_From 1 January 2012, a considerable increase in the taxation of NOx was implemented. The tax was originally introduced as part of a 2008 energy agreement with effect from 1 January 2010. It has been estimated that the increase in 2012 will lead to a 10 million kg reduction in the emissions of NOx.
_x000D_In March 2012 a general agreement on Danish energy policy from 2012-2020 was made. The agreement seeks to ensure the transition from an energy supply based on fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy. The initiatives from the agreement are yet to be realised.
_x000D_In addition, a change in the structure of the taxation of solar panels was passed in November 2012; a change estimated to keep the incentive to install solar panels, and expected to lead to a 0.2 million tonne reduction in CO2 emissions. As the first part of an increased tax level on heating (tax on security of energy supply), the taxes on fossil fuels were increased from 1 February 2013. From the first part, a reduction in CO2 emissions of 0.08 million tonnes in 2013 increasing to 0.48 million tonnes in 2020 was expected. This second part has never been passed as the tax on security of energy supply was undone in 2014. The estimated CO2 emission accumulated from 2014 to 2020 from undoing this tax was 1.83 million tonnes, which however is planned to be offset completely by compensating measures such as for instance the establishment of biocovers. With the undoing of the tax on security of energy supply, the PSO tariff was reduced, which was estimated to cause an increase in CO2 emissions with 0.15 million tonnes in 2020.",,See individual PaMs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/Converters/run_conversion?file=/dk/eu/mmr/art04-13-14_lcds_pams_projections/pams/envvyjguq/DK_MMR_PAM_20150622.xml&conv=524&source=remote#pam1,See individual PaMs,See individual PaMs,See individual PaMs,No,Energy Taxation Directive 2003/96/EC,,
